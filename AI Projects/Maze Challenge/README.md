# challenge - maze problem

### TODO:
implement an algorithm that can find the way out of a maze.
___________________________________________________________________________

The map Input will be 2D array, like this:

[

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

[1, 2, 0, 1, 1],

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1],

[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],

[1, 1, 1, 1, 3]

]

- integer 0 represents the places we can move in.
- integer 1 represents walls
- integer 2 is the starting point ("a maze can not have more than One Starting Point").
- integer 3 is the Exit ("A maze can have more than One Exit, and the Exit can be anywhere on the maze").
